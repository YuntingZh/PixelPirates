        <p> <strong>Summary:</strong> Centered on advancing particle simulation within a computer graphics framework, our project aims to craft a technically sophisticated scene. We plan to feature fluid dynamics and shader effects to simulate water, fog, and smoke. Additionally, we hope to delve into animation and interactive elements, including a dynamically moving sea monster and boat. While excited about incorporating storytelling elements, our primary focus lies in overcoming technical challenges and fostering innovations, especially in fluid simulation and shader development, to achieve both realism and striking visual appeal.

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description:</strong> Our project confronts two primary challenges within the realm of computer graphics and particle simulation. Firstly, we aim to explore the complex interaction between water and wind, focusing on how these dynamics influence and collide with objects within the sea environment, specifically a sea monster and a boat. This involves developing a robust simulation that can accurately model fluid dynamics and physical interactions. Secondly, we seek to innovate in the area of animation tracking. Our goal is to create a seamless and intuitive animation track for the camera movement that harmoniously interacts with the independent animations of the objects in the scene, including the sea monster and the boat. These challenges are significant as they require a deep understanding of physics-based simulation and animation principles, pushing the boundaries of realism and interactivity in computer graphics.</p>
