        <p> <strong>Summary:</strong> Centered on advancing particle simulation within a computer graphics framework,
            our project aims to craft a technically sophisticated scene. We plan to feature fluid dynamics and shader
            effects to simulate water, fog, and smoke. Additionally, we hope to delve into animation and interactive
            elements, including a dynamically moving sea monster and boat. While excited about incorporating
            storytelling elements, our primary focus lies in overcoming technical challenges and fostering innovations,
            especially in fluid simulation and shader development, to achieve both realism and striking visual appeal.

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description:</strong> Our project confronts two primary challenges within the realm of
            computer graphics and particle simulation. Firstly, we aim to explore the complex interaction between water
            and wind, focusing on how these dynamics influence and collide with objects within the sea environment,
            specifically a sea monster and a boat. This involves developing a robust simulation that can accurately
            model fluid dynamics and physical interactions. Secondly, we seek to innovate in the area of animation
            tracking. We will be performing Inverse Fast Fourier Transform and the result will be heightmap. Our goal is
            to create a seamless and intuitive animation track for the camera movement that
            harmoniously interacts with the independent animations of the objects in the scene, including the sea
            monster and the boat. These challenges are significant as they require a deep understanding of physics-based
            simulation and animation principles, pushing the boundaries of realism and interactivity in computer
            graphics.</p>

        <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>

            <p class="feedback-and-response-header">Response to Feedback:</p>
            <p><strong>Feedback from TA - Anjali Thakrar:</strong>Your proposed implementation, deliverables, and stretch goals were all very clear. Your timeline looks great and leaves plenty of room for implementing extra features or fixing unexpected bugs. I really like this idea and think it will lead to really exciting and dramatic sea renderings.</p>
            <p>A couple thoughts:</p>
            <p>Success metrics:<br>
            I appreciate that you included these metrics! It’s incredibly important to map out prior to implementation in order to have a shared, clear idea of your end product.</p>
            <p>One of your success metrics is “Effective implementation of fog and smoke simulations, enhancing the scene's atmospheric depth.” <span style="color: #01579b;">(It is a visual metric and we are planning to learn and simulate it. This is our aspirational goal, lower priority than finishing the basic scene setup, which is the water simulation.)</span></p>
            <p>You also mention user feedback. How do you plan to get this feedback? Will that be an internal qualitative metric for your team, or will you be using this for an in-depth analysis of your rendering quality?</p>
            <p>How do you plan to model your fluid simulation? Some popular frameworks are FLIP, MPM, PIC, and SPH, but you’re welcome to use anything that excites you!</p>
            <p>What’s your starting point? Will you be building this from scratch, extending a class HW, or adding to an existing codebase? <span style="color: #01579b;">(Our initial plan is to use Unreal and learn the fluid simulation part of it. We won't be starting from scratch because there is already a full-fledged simulator in Unreal, but we want to build our own ocean in it using graphic script to simulate very realistic effects and interactivity!)</span></p>
